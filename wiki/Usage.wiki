This page explains how to use the API provided by this package.

= Hook =
In order to use *php-aop*, there are two simple steps to follow:
* include the *php-aop* script once in the entry point file of the project
* register any class that *php-aop* needs to care about

== Project Entry Point ==
The *php-aop* script must be included once (actually, one can include the script multiple times without any problems albeit performance degradation) at the entry point of the project:
{{{
 require_once "aop/aop.php";
}}}
== Per Class ==
In order to insert _joinpoints_ in any class, the following must be added to the beginning of the file:
{{{
 aop::register('put-classname-here');
}}}

== Per Method ==
Joinpoints can be added on a per-method basis as illustrated below:

{{{
/**
 * Method Name
 *  Description
 *
 * @param $inputParameter Some-description
 * @return $result Some-description
 *
 * @before  class-name::method-name
 * @after
 * @around
 */
}}}
