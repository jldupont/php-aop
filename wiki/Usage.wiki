This page explains how to use the API provided by this package.

= Hook =
In order to use *php-aop*, there are two simple steps to follow:
* include the *php-aop* script once in the entry point file of the project
* register the project's class path

== Project Entry Point ==
The *php-aop* script must be included once (actually, one can include the script multiple times without any problems albeit performance degradation) at the entry point of the project:
{{{
 require_once "aop/aop.php";
}}}
== Class Path ==
*php-aop* relies on PHP's SPL autoloading functionality. In order to weave the _advices_ in the class code, each class in the project must be registered with *php-aop*:
{{{
 aop::register_class_path('put-classpath-information-here');
}}}
The above line should be put in the entry point script just below the *require_once "aop/aop.php";* statement.

===Examples===
 1- The project's class path is located relative to the entry point script in _classes_ :
 {{{
  aop::register_class_path( dirname(__FILE__) . '/classes' );
 }}}

 2- The project's class path is located in the PEAR path in 'project_X/classes' :
 {{{
  aop::register_class_path( 'project_X/classes' );
 }}}

= Class Hierarchy =
For *php-aop* to work, all classes must be loaded through the *php-aop* framework; thus, no *include* or *require* statements must be used, doing so would bypass *php-aop*.

==File Layout==
The framework searches for classes in the following order:
  # $path / $className .php
  # $p = $path / $className / $className .php
  # $p = $path / $fragment-list .php
  # $p = $path / $fragment-list / $last_fragment .php
Where:
  * $path is the absolute path registered through ''aop::register_class_path''
  * $fragment-list is the path constructed by replacing the ''_'' underscores in the $className with DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR (i.e. ''/'')
  * $last_fragment corresponds to the part of the $className following the last ''_'' (e.g. this_long_class_name  => $last_fragment == ''name'')
For more information, please consult the code of the class located in ''/finder/finder.php''.
